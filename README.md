Project Overview

This project demonstrates various object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, including single inheritance, multilevel inheritance, hierarchical inheritance, and encapsulation. Each problem showcases a real-world scenario and how these OOP principles can be applied effectively to solve them.

Problem: Hierarchical Inheritance

Scenario:
A vehicle showroom wants to classify its inventory into different types.

Classes and Functionality:
	1. Vehicle (Base Class):
		• Attributes:
			• brand (String)
			• model (String)
			• price (double)
		• Methods:
		• displayDetails(): Prints the vehicle’s details.
	2. Car (Subclass of Vehicle):
		• Attributes:
			• numberOfDoors (int)
		• Methods:
			• Overrides displayDetails() to include car-specific attributes.
	3. Bike (Subclass of Vehicle):
		• Attributes:
			• engineCapacity (String)
		• Methods:
			• Overrides displayDetails() to include bike-specific attributes.

Main Method Tasks:
	• Create objects of Car and Bike.
	• Set their attributes using setters.
	• Call displayDetails() to display their details.
 
Main Method Tasks:
	• Create an object of Order.
	• Set attributes for User, Customer, and Order using setters.
	• Call displayCustomerInfo() to display all details.

 Key Concepts Covered
	1. Encapsulation: Use of private attributes and public getter/setter methods to protect data.
	2. Inheritance: Demonstrates single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance.
	3. Polymorphism: Overriding methods to provide specific implementations in subclasses.
	4. Object-Oriented Design: Application of OOP principles to solve real-world scenarios.

 How to Run the Program
	1. Ensure you have a Java development environment set up (e.g., JDK and an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
	2. Create individual Java files for each problem or combine them into one file.
	3. Compile and run the program to test each scenario.
