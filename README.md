Project Overview

This project demonstrates various object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, including single inheritance, multilevel inheritance, hierarchical inheritance, and encapsulation. Each problem showcases a real-world scenario and how these OOP principles can be applied effectively to solve them.

Problems

Problem 1: Single Inheritance

Scenario:
A company wants to manage its employees and their departments.

Classes and Functionality:
	1. Employee (Base Class):
		• Private Attributes:
			• employeeId (String)
			• name (String)
			• department (String)
		• Methods:
			• Getters and setters for all attributes.
	2. Manager (Subclass):
		• Attributes:
			• bonus (double).
		• Methods:
			• calculateTotalSalary(double baseSalary): Calculates and returns the sum of base salary and bonus.

Main Method Tasks:
	• Create an object of Manager.
	• Set attributes using setters.
	• Call calculateTotalSalary() and display the manager’s details along with the total salary.

Main Method Tasks:
	• Create an object of Order.
	• Set attributes for User, Customer, and Order using setters.
	• Call displayCustomerInfo() to display all details.

 Key Concepts Covered
	1. Encapsulation: Use of private attributes and public getter/setter methods to protect data.
	2. Inheritance: Demonstrates single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance.
	3. Polymorphism: Overriding methods to provide specific implementations in subclasses.
	4. Object-Oriented Design: Application of OOP principles to solve real-world scenarios.

 How to Run the Program
	1. Ensure you have a Java development environment set up (e.g., JDK and an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
	2. Create individual Java files for each problem or combine them into one file.
	3. Compile and run the program to test each scenario.
